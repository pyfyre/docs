# Deployment

PyFyre is a static-site generator like React.js and Vue. To deploy a PyFyre application is really quite easy.

To create a build files:

```
cd <app_directory>
pyfyre build
```

And it will produce all the files needed to deploy your application through Netlify, Vercel, or other static site hosting platform.

## Netlify

Create a `netlify.toml` file on the main app directory (not in the build) and paste this:

{% code title="netlify.toml" %}
```toml
[build]
  # Directory to change to before starting a build.
  # This is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc.
  # If not set, defaults to the root directory.
  base = "/"

  # Directory that contains the deploy-ready HTML files and 
  # assets generated by the build. This is relative to the base
  # directory if one has been set, or the root directory if 
  # a base has not been set. This sample publishes the directory 
  # located at the absolute path "root/project/build-output"
  
  publish = "build/"

  # Default build command.
  command = "pip install PyFyre && pyfyre build"

  from = "/*"
  to = "/"
  status = 200
  force = false
```
{% endcode %}

Add the requirements.txt and only add pyfyre to it:

{% code title="requirements.txt" %}
```
pyfyre
```
{% endcode %}

Add `runtime.txt`, runtime.txt tells Netlify that we're using a specific Python version, in our case, it's `3.8`

```
3.8
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
`3.8` with no spaces, indentation, or skipped lines.
{% endhint %}

And this is now ready for Netlify deployment. Happy hacking!
